Koken cms for photographers has been abbandoned by its developers. The original project 
sadly died and I havn't found any suitible replacement. So trying to keep koken alive 
for my personal portfolios

Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/SloppySyntax/koken.git

Update database.php to your db credentials and ignore its path for changes

git update-index --skip-worktree ./storage/configuration/database.php
